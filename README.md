##What to Modify
The files you should modify (if you don't want to touch Bootstrap) are as follows:
* index.html
* css/responsive.css
* css/sic_style.css
* js/dav-motion.js

Technically if you leave the above intact, you *can* delete bootstrap files it should work like usual. (Issue /#8 references this directly.)

##License
As per [Hackathon rules](http://stamfordhackathon.org/sample-page/faq/), this project is released under a GPLv3 license.
